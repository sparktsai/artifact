### Are We Really “Governing” AI?

As AI begins to participate directly in engineering execution,  
we quickly learn one thing:

It can write faster.  
It can change more.  
It can run endlessly.

But one critical question is rarely asked.

**When something goes wrong,  
can we answer this:  
On what premises was this decision made?**

In most teams, the instinctive response to risk looks familiar:

- Add more processes  
- Add more policies  
- Add more reviews  
- Add more documentation  

Yet once an outcome already exists,  
if it cannot be aligned back to the premises that allowed it,  
these measures become nothing more than post-hoc explanations.

AI problems are rarely about *what went wrong*.

They are about what we can no longer explain:

- Which factors were considered important  
- How behavioral boundaries were understood  
- Why this outcome was considered acceptable  

When these questions have no answers,  
governance stops being an engineering problem  
and becomes a matter of luck.

**The real risk is not whether a system works today.  
It is whether anyone dares to touch it three years later.**

When AI-driven engineering lacks traceable decision premises,  
time does not reduce risk — it amplifies it.

In this article, I return to a more fundamental question:

> **If AI actions cannot be traced back to their decision premises,  
> what exactly are we governing?**
