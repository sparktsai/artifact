> **When AI systems fail, we often ask the wrong question.**

Most AI governance efforts today focus on outcomes:

*   Was the output acceptable?
*   Did it violate a rule?
*   Should we remediate?

But what if the real problem isn’t the result at all?

Over the past few articles, I’ve been exploring a pattern that keeps repeating in AI-assisted engineering:

*   AI systems are inherently non-deterministic.
*   Execution speed is amplified, while responsibility structures quietly collapse.
*   Constraints are added, but only after behavior has already occurred.
*   Governance slowly degrades into post-hoc audit.

At that point, governance no longer shapes decisions.  
It only reacts to them.

In practice, this leaves teams with two undesirable roles:

*   **Real-time firefighting**, interrupting workflows mid-execution
*   **Post-hoc review overload**, where human understanding can’t keep up with AI output

Neither makes systems more predictable.  
Neither makes responsibility clearer.

The question we should be asking is simpler—and harder:

> **Can we explain why a decision happened, before it happens?**

If governance can only audit outcomes,  
then risk has already accumulated.
