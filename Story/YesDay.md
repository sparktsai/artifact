# Yes Day (Interlude)

They woke up at the same time.

Ethan reached for his phone first.
Leo stayed in bed for another minute, staring at the ceiling.

“New place opened near the gate,” Leo said.
“People were lining up last night.”

Ethan glanced at the screen.
“I’ll pass.”

“Why?”

“No reviews yet,” Ethan said. “Too random.”

Leo laughed.
“Man, if you don’t waste twenty minutes on a bad breakfast, are you even a student?”

Ethan smiled.
“Exactly.”

He logged the meal anyway.
Calories, macros, mood.
Nothing dramatic.

They left together.

---

Class ended without ceremony.
Chairs folded. Bags zipped. People drifted toward the exit.

“Where to?” Leo asked.

Ethan checked his phone.
“Library. I want to go over today’s notes.”

“Already?”

“While it’s still fresh.”

He showed Leo the screen.
Notes broken into short sections.
A few lines marked.

“These parts I’m not sure about,” Ethan said.
“I’ll check them.”

Leo looked closer.
“This thing of yours… can it also show where it’s less crowded?”

“It can,” Ethan said. “But that’s based on where I usually stay comfortable.”

“For you.”

Ethan nodded.

“That might not work for me,” Leo said.

“Probably,” Ethan said. “You don’t need quiet.”

They split without making a plan.

---

An hour later, Leo spotted Ethan again—this time at the café.

“I thought you were staying at the library,” Leo said.

“I was,” Ethan said. “Too many people.”

Leo smiled.
“Didn’t think you’d be the one to leave first.”

Ethan glanced at the menu, then his phone.

“Lunch?” Leo asked.

“Yeah. It usually works for me.”

Leo lifted the cup carrier.
“I’m just here for coffee. My girlfriend asked me to bring some back.”

“That makes sense,” Ethan said.

They ordered.
Leo picked what she liked.
Ethan picked what he always did.

They didn’t mention the library again.

---

The afternoon didn’t stay where it was supposed to.

Ethan’s schedule had already been set:
study block, break, gym.

The reminder came and went.
He didn’t see it.

He was still arguing with the model.

One paragraph contradicted another.
The explanation sounded right, then didn’t.

He asked again.
Rephrased.
Narrowed the scope.

The responses improved, then drifted.

By the time the report finally held together,
the gym window had already closed.

The system logged it as a miss.

---

Leo carried the coffee upstairs.

Her door was open.

He set the cups on the desk.
She didn’t thank him.

“Before dinner,” she said.

He sat where she could see the screen.

The prompt was short.
The output came fast.

He pasted it in.
Adjusted the formatting.
Fixed the references.

She watched the cursor move.

---

The file exported.
The upload bar finished.

The timestamp turned green.

“Done,” he said.

She checked once, then nodded.

That night, the room went quiet.

Ethan lay on his bed, phone face down.
He didn’t need to check anything.

Breakfast had been the right call.
No wasted time.

The library window had been perfect—
busy, but manageable.

The report held.
The logic was clean.
It went in on time.

The gym slot was gone,
but the day hadn’t broken.

Everything landed where it should have.

On the other bed, Leo turned over.

He thought about the report—
not the content, but the speed.

That tool really was good.

Fast. Clean. Reliable.

He understood, finally,
why Ethan kept going back to it.

Not because it was easier.

Because it worked.

The room stayed still.

Two people, lying awake,
carrying different certainties
into sleep.
