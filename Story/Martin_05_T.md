**(Found Notes)**

This page had a small stain.
As if something had been set down
and lifted again
without much thought.

I scanned a barcode today.

Not for speed.
Not for automation.
Just to avoid typing.

The product name appeared.
So did its category.

Food.
Household.
Transport.

I stopped.

I had been trying to invent a classification system
for expenses.
Carefully.
Deliberately.
As if it were my responsibility.

But the structure was already there.
Maintained by someone else.
Updated daily.
Used by millions.

I didn’t need a new model.
I needed permission
to reuse an existing one.

I wired the categories into the ledger.
No abstraction.
No configuration.

It felt like cheating.

Later, I realized
it wasn’t a shortcut.
It was alignment.

The system got lighter
without adding anything.
