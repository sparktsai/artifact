**(Found Notes)**

This page was written slowly.
Not revised.
Just finished.

It’s been half a year.

Long enough
that nothing feels urgent anymore.
Short enough
that I still remember
why it once did.

I can see the whole thing now.
Not the app.
The process.

Where I hesitated.
Where I deleted.
Where I waited
instead of adding one more thing.

I used to think
that was why I was asked to leave.

That I was too careful.
Too slow.
Too unwilling to agree.

I don’t think that anymore.

The world didn’t need me to change.
It needed me to decide faster
than I was willing to.

That’s a different skill.

I didn’t lose it.
I just stopped practicing it
when it stopped making sense.

I’ve built more in these months
than I did in years before.

Not because I learned faster,
but because I stopped arguing
with what didn’t belong.

Distance doesn’t make things clearer.
It makes them quieter.

And in the quiet,
some decisions finally sound
like what they always were.

Necessary.
