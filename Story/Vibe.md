## ACT I — Morning

### Scene 1: Conference Room

**BOSS**  
I had a thought this morning.  
Not a requirement.  
Just a direction.  
A vibe.

**BOSS**  
Can we have something by lunch?

*(Silence.)*

**ENGINEER**  
Yes.

*(Lights down.)*

…  
(softly)  
It will change anyway.

*(He opens the editor. Closes it.)*

### Scene 4: CS on the Phone

*(Phone ringing.)*

**CS**  
Yes.  
That’s correct.

Yes, it’s the same as this morning.

*(Slack notification sound.)*

*(A 0.5 second pause.)*

**CS** *(steady voice)*  
Yes.  
No change.

*(Hangs up. Looks at the screen.)*

I don’t know which version this is anymore.

## ACT V — Vibe Coding

### Scene 5: Demo

*(AI projection turns on.)*

**AI**  
I’ve generated a solution that matches your vibe.

*(Code and UI move fast.)*

**BOSS** *(smiling)*  
Great.  
That’s the feeling.

**BOSS**  
Can we add a little more?

**AI**  
Of course.

*(The output changes instantly.)*

**ENGINEER**  
…

## ACT VI — Acceleration

### Scene 6: Everyone on Stage

*(All characters act at once.)*

- **BOSS** pacing
- **ENGINEER** staring
- **FAE** rewriting documents
- **CS** answering calls
- **AI** constantly changing output

*(A version counter flashes rapidly in the background.)*  
*v1.0 → v1.2 → v2.0-beta-final → v2.0-final-fixed*

**FAE** *(reading filenames)*  
External\Statement\v2\Final.docx  
v3\Final\Really.docx

**CS** *(on phone)*  
Yes, that’s correct.

*(Another call.)*

I understand the confusion.

We’ll confirm again.

*(Sounds overlap. Lights flicker.)*

### Scene 7: A Corner of the Stage

*(ENGINEER packs up his desk.)*

**ENGINEER**  
I’m going to build something small.

Oh.  
Nice.  
Good luck.

*(ENGINEER exits.)*

*(No one follows.)*

## ACT VIII — Boundary

### Scene 8: Engineer and AI

**ENGINEER**  
Only this function.  
Don’t touch anything else.

**AI**  
Understood.

*(Code appears quickly.)*

**ENGINEER**  
If it breaks, we delete it.

**AI**  
Sounds good.

*(ENGINEER smiles — briefly.)*

## FINAL ACT — Startup Edition

### Scene 9: CS’s Screen

*(Lights focus on a screen.)*

A line appears:

> **Plan changed: Startup Edition**

*(CS stares at it.)*

*(He closes the laptop.)*

*(Picks up the phone. For the first time, he doesn’t look at any screen.)*

**CS**  
Yes.  
This version won’t change.

*(Pause.)*

Because if it does,  
I’ll tell you.

*(Lights fade.)*

## Optional Epilogue (Voice-over)

The system didn’t slow down.  
For the first time,  
responsibility became visible.
