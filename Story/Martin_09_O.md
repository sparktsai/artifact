**(Found Notes)**

There was nothing left to adjust.

That’s how I knew it was time.

---

I packaged the app today.

No feature list.
No onboarding tour.
No explanation longer than a sentence.

It does one thing.
It does it the same way
every time.

I watched the progress bar finish
and felt nothing.

No relief.
No pride.
Just a quiet sense
that I was no longer the one
holding it together.

I uploaded it
and closed the editor.

For the first time,
the system existed
without me watching it.

That used to scare me.

Now it feels like a requirement.

If it can’t survive
being misunderstood,
it doesn’t belong outside my desk.

Someone will use it wrong.
Someone will want more.
Someone will ask
why it doesn’t do what it could.

That’s fine.

Release isn’t about reaching people.
It’s about letting go
before attachment turns into complexity.

Today,
nothing broke.

That’s enough.
