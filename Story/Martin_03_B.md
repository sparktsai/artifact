**(Found Notes)**

This page had no folds.  
No marks.  
It looked untouched,  
as if nothing had happened yet.

The office badge stopped working today.

Not because it expired,  
but because I no longer had a place  
to tap it.

I brought my laptop home  
and put it on the table  
where nothing had ever been deployed before.

There was no backlog.  
No roadmap.  
No one waiting.

Just time.

I told myself I would start small.  
I didn’t.

I asked AI to help me rebuild  
something I already understood.  
Accounting.  
Entries.  
Balances.  
Things that still worked  
even when everything else changed.

It produced results quickly.  
Faster than I expected.

For a moment,  
I wondered if I had been wrong all along.  
If speed was all that mattered now.  
If experience was just latency  
disguised as caution.

I didn’t write anything down that day.

I thought I would remember  
how it felt  
to begin with nothing  
and still hesitate.

I was wrong.
