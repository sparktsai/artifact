**(Found Notes)**

This entry was dated.
Only this one.

---

It’s been a month.

People kept using it.
Quietly.
Consistently.

No spikes.
No complaints.
Just patterns.

I started reading the notes again.
Not the code.
The explanations.
The decisions I thought were finished.

That’s where the gaps were.

Not bugs.
Not missing features.

Assumptions.

Things that had made sense
because I was still nearby
when I wrote them.

Someone used it differently
and nothing broke.
But something became unclear.

I rewrote a paragraph.
Then another.

The system stayed the same.
My understanding didn’t.

Feedback didn’t change the product.
It changed the record of why
the product was allowed to exist
this way.

That used to feel like rework.

Now it feels like maintenance
of a different kind.

The app hasn’t grown.
But the file explaining it has.

That’s fine.

If the system is light,
the weight has to live somewhere.

This month,
it lived in the document.
