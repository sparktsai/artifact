# Martin · Day R

**(Found Notes)**

I came across this journal while cleaning up old project files.  
The filename was plain. No date. Just a name: **Martin**.

No one really talked about him.  
Only that after he left, some things became harder to maintain.

This page was marked with a single letter.

I started over again.

Not because something was wrong,  
but because I realized I had been making the same decision all along:  
finishing things,  
instead of making them fast.

AI worked well today.  
I described what I wanted, and it quickly produced a system  
that looked complete.  
Too complete.

I stared at the screen for a while  
and began deleting features one by one.  
Not because they were useless,  
but because I knew  
six months from now  
I wouldn’t remember why I kept them.

Stability isn’t about staying the same.  
It’s about making sure that  
when the next change comes,  
someone can still understand what was done.

That’s enough for today.  
If I write any more,  
the system will start getting heavy again.
