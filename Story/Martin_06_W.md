**(Found Notes)**

This page had a corner bent back.
Not to mark it,
but to return quickly
when something broke.

---

It worked in the usual cases.

That was what worried me.

I tried entering expenses
out of order.
Refunds before purchases.
Cash after credit.
Categories that didn’t quite fit.

The app didn’t crash.
It hesitated.

Numbers appeared,
then corrected themselves.
Balances held,
but only if I followed the path
it expected.

I wrote down each situation
as it happened.
Not the bug,
but the context.

Because I knew
I wouldn’t remember
why this case mattered
a month from now.

I asked AI to test with me.

It was good at repeating steps.
Bad at imagining why
someone would do things differently.

That wasn’t a flaw.
It was a boundary.

Systems don’t fail at the center.
They fail at the edges,
where assumptions go to rest.

I folded the page back
so I could find it again.
