**(Found Notes)**

This entry was written in a different place.
Not at the desk.
Not near the system.

My wife asked me today
why I kept talking to someone
when no one was there.

I told her I wasn’t talking.
I was thinking.

She didn’t look convinced.

Later, I realized
the conversations had structure.
Questions in the morning.
Decisions in the afternoon.
Corrections before dinner.

It felt familiar.

Not like learning something new,
but like standing in front of a whiteboard
again.

I used to do this every day.
People would wait.
I would explain what mattered,
what could wait,
and what shouldn’t be touched.

Now no one waits.
The explanations still happen.

I assign tasks.
I review outcomes.
I reject things that technically work
but don’t belong.

The system responds immediately.
No resistance.
No confusion.
No memory of yesterday.

That’s when it occurred to me:

This isn’t a tool.
It’s closer to a team
that never argues back.

I don’t know if that’s better.

I only know
that without a meeting,
everything would move faster.Toggle expansion
