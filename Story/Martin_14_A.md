**(Found Notes)**

This page was not filed
with the others.

It was left on the desk.

I met an old colleague today.

We talked about the project
I left behind.

It’s still not finished.

Not because it’s broken,
but because it keeps becoming
something else.

They added a few more features.
Then a few more meetings.
Then a new plan to simplify it later.

He said it was complicated now.
Hard to change.
Hard to explain
why it was the way it was.

He sounded tired.

I listened.
I didn’t compare.

Later, at home,
I opened my folder.

The app was still there.
So were the notes.
So was the list of things
it was never meant to do.

Nothing had moved.

That’s when it occurred to me:

The problem was never the tools.
Or the methods.
Or the speed.

It was whether anyone
was willing to decide
what something was allowed to become
and stay with that decision
when it stopped being convenient.

I closed the folder.

Some things don’t need
a better ending.

They just need
to be left intact.
