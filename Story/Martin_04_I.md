**(Found Notes)**

This page was creased along the edge.
Not folded.
Pressed.

The list got longer today.

Not because anything was broken,
but because each new feature
seemed reasonable
when looked at alone.

I added one.
Then another.
Each time telling myself
this would be the last.

The system still worked.
That was the problem.

Nothing failed loudly enough
to justify stopping.

I opened the feature list
and read it from top to bottom.
Halfway through,
I couldn’t remember
why some of them were there.

That was new.

I didn’t remove anything yet.
I just wrote this down.

Weight doesn’t arrive all at once.
It accumulates
while everything is still functioning.

If you wait until it hurts,
it’s already too late.
