**(Found Notes)**

This page was folded once.  
Not carefully.  
As if he meant to come back to it,  
but didn’t.

AI suggested adding one more feature today.

It made sense.  
It always does.

The feature would improve usability.  
It would cover more cases.  
It would make the system feel complete.

I said no.

Not immediately.  
I reread the suggestion twice,  
trying to find the part that was wrong.

There wasn’t one.

That was the problem.

AI never hesitates.  
It never asks what the system is allowed to become.  
It only asks what else it can do.

I closed the editor without saving.

Not because I was angry,  
but because I realized  
this was the first time  
I had to stop something  
that was technically correct.

Speed would have said yes.  
Experience didn’t.

I wrote this down  
so I wouldn’t forget  
how easy it is  
to agree your way  
into something you can no longer carry.
