**(Found Notes)**

This page was copied.
Not rewritten.
The margins stayed the same.

I moved the system today.

Not to add reach,
but to see
if it would survive being elsewhere.

I didn’t change the core.
I didn’t rewrite the rules.
I only told AI
where it was allowed to run.

It asked fewer questions than before.

That surprised me.

What used to take days
now took hours.
Not because it was faster,
but because nothing needed to be re-decided.

The documents still made sense.
The constraints still held.
The tests still described the same situations.

The system felt familiar
in a place it had never been.

That’s when I understood
what the first deletion had really done.

I hadn’t made it smaller.
I had made it movable.

Portability isn’t about platforms.
It’s about carrying decisions
without carrying their debates.

If something has to be re-explained
every time it moves,
it wasn’t finished.

Today,
the system moved
and stayed light.

I didn’t.
