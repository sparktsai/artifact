Not with comments,
but with roles.

I stopped treating AI as a single voice today.

Not because it was confusing,
but because it was too agreeable.

Everything sounded reasonable
when it came from the same place.

So I split the work.

One instance to explore.
One to question.
One to repeat the requirements
without improving them.
One to say what would break
if this went further.

They all responded instantly.
None of them knew about the others.

That helped.

The system changed shape
without growing heavier.
Decisions became visible again,
not because they were better,
but because they had a place to stand.

This is how teams used to work.
Not consensus,
but separation.

Speed comes from agreement.
Stability comes from friction.

I don’t need the answers to argue back.
I need them to disagree
without remembering how.

That way,
when something goes wrong,
I know where to look.
