This page was opened more than once.
Nothing was added.
Only spacing changed.

People started asking for more today.

Not loudly.
Not impatiently.

Just small questions.
Reasonable ones.

Could it work on another platform?
Could it sync?
Could it remember more?

They said they liked it.
They said it was simple.
They said it fit the way they thought.

Then they asked
if it could fit a little more.

I understood the request.
I always do.

Growth doesn’t arrive as pressure.
It arrives as trust.

I didn’t answer right away.

I opened the system
and looked for where those features would live.
Not how to build them,
but where they would stay
once they were done.

There wasn’t a place.

That wasn’t a flaw.
That was the point.

A system doesn’t say no with words.
It says no
by leaving nothing open.

I replied later.

Not with a roadmap.
Not with a promise.

Just with a question
about what they needed
that this didn’t already give them.

Some replied.
Some didn’t.

That’s fine.

Every request is an invitation
to redraw the boundary.

Today,
I left the line where it was.
